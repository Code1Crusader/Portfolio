    <h3>My hopes for INF 785</h3>
    <p>
      I have taken this module not only to get a better understanding of how data, databases, data warehousing and all related technologies and techniques are incorporated into small and large businesses, and how to reap the benefits of these technologies when they are properly and comprehensively installed and integrated but also out of interest for the subject. The skills and knowledge acquired through the completion of this module is invaluable in todayâ€™s world run by data, it will allow me to expand and combine my capabilities and knowledge on other related interest and subjects with the topics covered throughout this module giving me a unique perspective on the matter that may allow me to hopefully one day provide input and contribute to the world of data science and development.

    <h3>Topic 1: Datawarehousing fundamentals</h3>
    <p>
  A data warehouse is an information environment that provides an organization with strategic information for quality decision making by delivering an all-encompassing view of the organization through the integration of data from every operation and function carried-out by the organization and its systems. This includes current as well as historical data that is processed and analyzed to produce information that allows strategical maneuvering of the organization by its managers and executives without inhibiting day-to-day operations. A data warehouse is integrated into an organization in such a way so that all the information of the organization conforms to certain standards set out by the organization to allow for interactive and parameterized analyses of the organization and its operations to allow for improvement in areas identified by such an analysis to be lacking in performance. The main benefit of a data warehouse is its ability to take the masses of accumulated operational data collected over the years by an organization and turn that into actionable information presented through chart, diagrams, and reports. That said, all companies or organizations, from start-up to multinational have something to gain from making use of data warehousing and its applications. For large conglomerates with many departments a bottom-up approach to data warehousing might be more beneficial, having data marts for each department that feeds into one central data warehousing unifying the organizations data and information. For smaller companies that do not have many departments having started with a data warehouse and developing additional data marts that are dependent on the data warehouse as the company grows would be better suited, top-down approach. However, to get the best out of data warehousing, it needs to be meticulously cultivated according to the requirements of your organization and its future direction.
